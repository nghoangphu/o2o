usage: %MAIN% [options]

The Strongloop process manager.

Options:
  -h,--help           Print this message and exit.
  -v,--version        Print version and exit.
  -b,--base BASE      Base directory to work in (default `~/.strong-pm`).
  -l,--listen PORT    Listen on PORT for control (default 8701).
  -P,--base-port PORT Applications will run at PORT + service ID (default 3000).
  --driver DRIVER     Execution backend to use for running apps. Current drivers
                      are 'direct' and 'docker' (default `direct`).
  --skip-default-install
                      Disable 'npm install' phase of application deployments
                      made on this PM.
  --json-file-db      Persist deployment information and metrics in a JSON based
                      database. Not recommended for production use.

The base directory is used to save deployed applications, for working
directories, and for any other files the process manager needs to create.

The process manager will be controllable via HTTP on the port specified. That
port is also used for deployment with strong-deploy. Basic authentication
can be enabled for HTTP by setting the STRONGLOOP_PM_HTTP_AUTH environment
variable to <user>:<pass> (eg. strong-pm:super-secret). This is the same format
as used by the --http-auth option of pm-install.
