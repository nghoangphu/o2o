Atatus for Node.js
============================

Atatus Node.js agent allows you to monitor your Node.js application performance and captures errors in real-time.

[Create a free account](https:///www.atatus.com) to start monitoring your Node.js apps.

Installation & Setup
--------------------

Install atatus-node using npm:

```bash
npm install --save atatus-node
```

Require atatus-node in your node.js app:

```javascript
var atatus = require("atatus-node");
```

Start the atatus agent with your API key:

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY" });
```

See below for additional configuration options.

Configuration
-------------

The `atatus.start` can accept other options along with API Key. The options can be a combination of any of the following:

### appVersion

If you use an appVersion to identify releases of your app you can send it to Atatus. It is highly recommended to set App Version.

```javascript

// From your app Package.json
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", appVersion: require('./package.json').version });


// OR

// You can also directly assign it
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", appVersion: "1.0.0" });

```


### releaseStage

By default, Atatus looks at the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to see what releaseStage the script is running in. If that is not set, Atatus assumes you are running in production. If you want to override this behavior, you can set the `releaseStage` option:

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", releaseStage: "development" });
```

### projectRoot

Atatus can highlight stacktrace lines that are in your project, and automatically hides stacktrace lines from external libraries. If Atatus is not hiding external stacktrace lines, it is likely that the `projectRoot` is being incorrectly calculated. You can set `projectRoot` as part of the register call:

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", projectRoot: "/path/to/root" });
```

### tags

It is often very useful to send some extra info along with errors and performance metrics, so that you can filter them in the Atatus UI. To do this, you can set the `tags`:

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", tags: ['new-user', 'signup'] });
```

### customData

To debug error effectively, you can also send some meta data along with errors. To do this, you can set the `customData`:

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", customData: { foo: 'bar', name: "John Doe" }});
```

### proxy

You can use a proxy server by configuring a proxy url when registering with atatus.

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", proxy: "http://localhost:8080" });
```

### hostname

By default we'll fetch the hostname using Node's [os.hostname()](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html#os_os_hostname), but you can override this as follows:

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", hostname: "web1.example.com" });
```

### beforeErrorSend

If you want to modify error reports just before they are sent to Atatus, or prevent them from being sent, you can add before notify callbacks:

```javascript
Atatus.beforeErrorSend(function (payload) {

    var errorMessage = payload.exceptions[0].message;

    // Dont send Not found message
    if (errorMessage.indexOf('Not Found') === 0) {
        return false;
    }

    return true;
});
```

### sendCode

If you want to send code snippets for each frame of the stacktrace you can enable `sendCode`. This asynchronously loads any file from the stacktrace, which is within the scope of the project, and sends 3 lines either side of the erroneous line of code to Atatus.

This works almost the same as how Atatus JavaScript projects handle sourcemaps - however loading the code is done on the local machine and sent over the internet with the error data. By default, this option is enabled. If you don't want, you can disable it.

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", sendCode: false });
```

### groupingKey

If you need programmatical control over how the errors are grouped within atatus, you can send a groupingKey to the notify call. This will ensure that atatus groups all errors with the same groupingKey together.

```javascript
atatus.start({ apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY", groupingKey: function(payload) {
        // You can generate grouping based on error payload details or send static grouping key for all errors
        return "auth/create";
    }
});
```

Notify Error
------------

Atatus automatically captures exceptions and HTTP errors from your Node.js app. If you want to send error manually, you can do it by `atatus.notifyError` function. The  accepts an error as either a string or an Error object as the first argument, as well as options object as its second parameter. The second parameter may contain tags, custom data and user id.

```javascript
atatus.notifyError(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), { tags: ['new-user', 'signup'], customData: { name: 'John Doe', country: 'US' } });
```

### userId

A unique identifier for a user affected by this error. This could be any distinct identifier that makes sense for your application. In Express/Connect apps, this is automatically set to the ip address of the current request.

```javascript
atatus.notifyError(new Error("Something went badly wrong"), { userId: "someone@example.com" });
```
