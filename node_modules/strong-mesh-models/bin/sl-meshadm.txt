usage: %MAIN% [options] [command ...]

Administration of the Strongloop Mesh.

Options:
  -h,--help               Print help and exit.
  -v,--version            Print version and exit.
  -C,--control CTL        Control endpoint for process manager.

The control endpoint for the process manager is searched for if not specified,
in this order:

1. `STRONGLOOP_PM` in environment: may be a local domain path, or an HTTP URL.
2. `http://localhost:8701`: a process manager running on localhost

When using an HTTP URL, it can optionally be tunneled over ssh by changing the
protocol to `http+ssh://`. The ssh username will default to your current user
and authentication defaults to using your current ssh-agent. The username can be
overridden by setting an `SSH_USER` environment variable. The authentication can
be overridden to use an existing private key instead of an agent by setting the
`SSH_KEY` environment variable to the path of the private key to be used. The
port used for ssh defaults to the standard ssh port (22) but can be overridden
by setting the `SSH_PORT` environment variable.

Executor commands:

`EXEC` is the executor ID. It can be obtained by listing executors using
`exec-list`.

  exec-create             Create an executor.
  exec-remove EXEC        Remove executor EXEC.
  exec-list               List executors.
  exec-shutdown EXEC      Shutdown executor EXEC.

Gateway controller commands:

`GW` is the gateway controller ID. It can be obtained by listing gateway
controllers using `gw-list`.

  gw-create               Create a gateway controller.
  gw-remove GW            Remove gateway controller GW.
  gw-list                 List gateway controllers.
  gw-shutdown GW          Shutdown gateway controller GW.
